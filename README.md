Official repository for the paper "On the impact of lowering temperature on learning with behavior clones"

# Introduction

This repo is the code base used to generate the results in the paper "On the impact of lowering temperature on learning with behavior clones". This paper (and therefore this code) explores the effect of behavior clones' temperature when training an agent with it in a collaborative setting.
The purpose of doing so is to enable better adaptation of agent's behavior when collaborating with humans.

Details of the rules of the game can be found [here](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai) which this repo is based on.
